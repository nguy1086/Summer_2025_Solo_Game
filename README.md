Radioactive Spire is a 2D pixel art hack'n'slash/beat'em up game by ***COMPANY NAME WIP***.<br/>
You play as the Batter, one day during a normal day in high school a nuclear fallout happened.<br/>
What came afterwards, a corrupted government has taken over the world.<br/>
Miraculously surviving the fallout, you rise up from the debris of what was left of your old life.<br/>
